<div class="jumbotron" style='about.css'><h1>Data Geyser</h1><p>Data Geyser is a virtual reality enabled, immersive and interactive data visualization experience combining art and cutting-edge technology. Users can manipulate a 3D globe to view geographic and time-series Twitter data from different angles, and trigger visualization events. The triggers display a variety of stunning, interactive data-relevant visualizations.</p>
<script>$('#gui').remove();</script>
</p>The app can be experienced either in the browser or using the Oculus Rift headset. The app can be controlled using either the mouse or Leap Motion Controller. The Leap controls movement by reading the absolute position of the hand relative to the controller, not by registering relative movement. To zoom in, hold hand closer to controller (y-axis)...zoom out by holding hand farther away. Rotate left and right by holding hand at left or right sides (x-axis) of controller. Rotate up and down by moving hand forward or backwards along z-axis. To visualize in Oculus, attach unit and select the Oculus option. This will also remove the GUI from the view, so adjustments to preferred visualization must be made prior to launching with Oculus.</p>
